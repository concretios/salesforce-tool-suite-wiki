## 🌟 What is Salesforce Tool Suite?

Salesforce Tool Suite is a Chrome extension that provides metadata comparison, schema exploration, debug log monitoring, and bulk operations - all leveraging Chrome Extension APIs for capabilities beyond standard web apps.

### Key Differentiators

Unlike web-based Salesforce tools, this Chrome extension offers:
- **Session Cookie Access**: Automatically reads your active Salesforce tab's session cookie for seamless authentication
- **Chrome APIs**: Leverages browser APIs for downloads, notifications, background processing, and more
- **OAuth Support**: Connect to multiple Salesforce orgs simultaneously for comparison
- **Offline Capable**: Works with cached data when needed
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no external servers
